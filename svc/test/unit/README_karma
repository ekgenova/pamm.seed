Install nodeJS at https://nodejs.org/en/
This should give you npm access.
In your command line (cmd) type in npm to confirm it has installed properly.
Go to the test/unit directory in your cmd/terminal.
Type in:
npm install
Assuming you donâ€™t have proxy issues, this should install all the required dependencies into a node_modules folder,
if you have proxy issues go onto the wifi to download the dependencies
Next type in:
npm run test
All unit tests should then run in karma
