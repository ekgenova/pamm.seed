Install nodeJS at https://nodejs.org/en/
This should give you npm access.
In your command line (cmd) type in npm to confirm it has installed properly.
Go to the unit directory in your cmd/terminal.
Type in:
npm install
Assuming you don’t have proxy issues, this should install karma, karma-jasmine and karma-chrome-launcher for you.
Next type in:
Npm install –g karma-cli
This will let you install karma globally so you just need to type in karma start in the future to run karma instead of doing ./node_modules/karma/bin/karma start
