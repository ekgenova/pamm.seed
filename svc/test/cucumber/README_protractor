Install nodeJS at https://nodejs.org/en/
This should give you npm access.
In your command line (cmd) type in npm to confirm it has installed properly.

Ensure the application that you want to test is running.

Go to the test/cucumber directory in your cmd/terminal.
Type in:
npm install -g protractor
Assuming you don't have proxy issues,  this will install two command line tools, protractor and webdriver-manager globably.
If you recieve any errors please ignore. These do not seem to effect the installation.
The webdriver-manager is a helper tool to easily get an instance of a Selenium Server running.
Use it to download the necessary binaries with the following commands:
webdriver-manager update
webdriver-manager start

Next get depedencies: typem npm install

Now from the directory containing you configuration file run:
protractor <name of config file>

Tests should now run
