Install nodeJS at https://nodejs.org/en/
This should give you npm access.
In your command line (cmd) type in npm to confirm it has installed properly.
Go to the test/cucumber directory in your cmd/terminal.
Type in:
npm install -g protractor
Assuming you don't have proxy issues,  this will install two command line tools, protractor and webdriver-manager.
If you recieve any errors please ignore. These do not seem to effect the installation
The webdriver-manager is a helper tool to easily get an instance of a Selenium Server running.
Use it to download the necessary binaries with the following commands:
webdriver-manager update
webdriver-manager start
Type in to get all other dependencies:
npm install
Now from the directory containing you configuration file run:
npm run test
All e2e tests should then run in protractor
